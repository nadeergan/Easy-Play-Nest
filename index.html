  <h1>Privacy Policy - EasyPlayNest</h1>
  <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2026</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> EasyPlayNest takes your privacy seriously. We are committed to ensuring that our application is absolutely safe for children and protects your family's data. This policy outlines our strict privacy practices.</p>

  <h2>1. No Data Collection (Zero Data Policy)</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal information, usage data, or metadata. The application operates 100% offline. There are no user accounts, no registration forms, and no backend servers.</p>

  <h2>2. No Internet Connection Required</h2>
  <p>EasyPlayNest does not require an internet connection to function. It does not send any data to the cloud. This ensures that your child is protected from online tracking, third-party analytics, and unwanted content.</p>

  <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>We respect your device security. The app requests only the minimum necessary permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage Access (Read Only):</strong> This is required STRICTLY to allow parents to select specific local folders containing video/music files for the media player. We do not scan the device without permission and do not modify or delete your files.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Kids' Privacy (COPPA & GDPR)</h2>
  <p>EasyPlayNest is designed to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and GDPR. Because we do not collect any personal data whatsoever, there is no risk of data exposure. We do not use third-party advertising or analytics SDKs.</p>

  <h2>5. No Ads or In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>To provide a distraction-free environment, EasyPlayNest contains NO advertisements and NO in-app purchases. There are no hidden costs or commercially motivated interruptions.</p>

  <h2>6. Local Data Only</h2>
  <p>Any parental control settings (such as PIN codes, time limits, and activity logs) are stored securely and locally on the device's internal memory. This data is never synchronized with any external server.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
